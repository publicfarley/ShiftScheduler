## Next Steps: Phase 2

Phase 1 provides the complete Redux foundation. Phase 2 (Service Layer) will:

1. Create protocol-based service abstractions
2. Implement CalendarServiceProtocol
3. Implement PersistenceServiceProtocol
4. Implement ShiftSwitchServiceProtocol
5. Implement CurrentDayServiceProtocol
6. Create ServiceContainer for dependency injection
7. Implement mock services for testing

**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 days

## Session Notes

### Completed In This Session
- Set up Redux directory structure
- Implemented all 5 core Redux files
- Fixed Swift 6 concurrency issues
- Verified compilation
- Created comprehensive documentation

### Key Decisions Made
1. Used ChangeLogEntry for undo/redo stacks (aligned with existing domain)
2. Used os.Logger (not OSLog.Logger) for compatibility
3. Result type comparisons use pattern matching (Error is not Equatable)
4. All middleware marked @MainActor for thread safety
5. Store uses @Observable for automatic SwiftUI integration

### Challenges Encountered & Resolved
1. ❌ OSLog.Logger vs os.Logger → ✅ Fixed to use os.Logger
2. ❌ Privacy parameters in logger calls → ✅ Removed privacy specs
3. ❌ ShiftSwitchOperation type not found → ✅ Used ChangeLogEntry
4. ❌ Result<T, Error> not Equatable → ✅ Pattern matching in Equatable impl
5. ❌ ChangeLogEntry.description property → ✅ Used userDisplayName + changeType.displayName
