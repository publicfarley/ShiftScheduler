  - Full VoiceOver support and accessibility labels
  - Reduced Motion support

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Shift Types Tab**:
  - Replaced basic `ShiftTypeRow` with `EnhancedShiftTypeCard`
  - Added staggered entrance animations (0.05s delay per card)
  - Enhanced search bar with `.ultraThinMaterial` styling
  - Improved empty state with gradient icon and animations
  - Card count indicator below search bar
  - Smooth 30pt slide-up entrance with opacity fade

- **Locations Tab**:
  - Replaced basic `LocationRow` with `EnhancedLocationCard`
  - Added staggered entrance animations (0.05s delay per card)
  - Enhanced search bar with `.ultraThinMaterial` styling
  - Improved empty state with gradient icon and animations
  - Shift type count calculation per location
  - Card count indicator below search bar
  - Smooth 30pt slide-up entrance with opacity fade

#### Color System Updates
- **ShiftColorPalette**: Extended with location-specific color functions
  - `colorForLocation(_ locationName: String) -> Color`: Hash-based color selection from 6 teal/blue colors
  - `gradientColorsForLocation(_ locationName: String) -> (Color, Color)`: Gradient pair generation
  - `glowColorForLocation(_ locationName: String) -> Color`: Shadow glow color generation
  - Location color palette: Ocean Blue, Teal, Sky Blue, Turquoise, Azure, Sea Green
  - Professional, trustworthy feel distinct from shift type colors

#### Animation & Interaction
- Staggered card entrance animations using `AnimationPresets.standardSpring`
- Sequential delay pattern (0.05s * index) for visual polish
- Press scale effects (0.96) on Edit and Delete buttons using `DragGesture`
- Smooth state transitions using `AnimationPresets.quickSpring`
- Empty state animations with staggered icon, title, and button entrance
- Accessibility-aware animations that respect Reduced Motion settings

#### Accessibility
- Comprehensive VoiceOver labels for all card elements
- Descriptive button labels: "Edit [name]", "Delete [name]"
- Accessibility hints explaining button actions
- Support for Dynamic Type with appropriate font scaling
- Reduced Motion environment variable integration
- 44pt minimum tap targets for all interactive elements
- Proper semantic structure with `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)`

### Changed

#### Visual Refinements
- **Progressive Color Lightening**: Applied three rounds of refinements for optimal visual balance
  - Headers reduced from 90-95% to final 20-30% opacity
  - Symbol and badge backgrounds reduced to 30-40% opacity
  - Created softer, more elegant appearance
  - Improved readability with better contrast

- **Unified Button Styling**: Standardized Edit button colors
  - Both shift type and location cards use consistent teal: `Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.7, blue: 0.6)`
  - 20% opacity background overlay for glassmorphic effect
  - Shift/location color border at 40% opacity

- **Search Bar Enhancement**:
  - Added `.ultraThinMaterial` background
  - `.quaternary` border stroke for subtle definition
  - 14pt continuous corner radius
  - Improved visual consistency with card styling

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- Maintained separation of concerns with standalone card components
- Protocol-oriented design for future extensibility
- SwiftUI best practices with proper state management
- SwiftData integration for shift type count calculations

#### Performance
- Lazy loading with `LazyVStack` for efficient scrolling
- Optimized animations using built-in `AnimationPresets`
- Minimal re-renders with proper state scoping
- Efficient color generation using hash-based selection
